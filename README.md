# authParser
A simple python script that I wrote with the intention of parsing through text-based authorization logs. Pulls IP addresses out of a text file, and returns statistics about them. 

How2Use with Linux
1) Download authParser.py to a folder of your choice.
2) chmod +x authParser.py
3) ./authParser.py (path to the log)
